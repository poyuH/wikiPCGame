The game uses a traditional text and sprite-based visual novel model with an ADV-style text box running on the Ren'Py visual novel engine.  The game is licensed under the Creative Commons CC-BY-NC-ND.The majority of the story takes place at the fictional Yamaku High School for disabled students, located in an unnamed city somewhere in modern, northern Japan. The player takes the role of Hisao Nakai, an ordinary boy whose life changes dramatically after a heart attack caused by his long-dormant cardiac arrhythmia. After a lengthy hospitalization, he is forced to transfer to a school specialized in providing education and healthcare for students with disabilities. Over the course of the narrative, Hisao has the opportunity to come to grips with his condition and adjust to his new life.The gameplay of Katawa Shoujo is choice-based, in which the player reads through text and occasionally has the chance to respond to prompts with a variety of preset responses. The decisions made initiate possible events or dialogue within the story. Depending on the choices made by the player, the story branches into multiple forks. Each of these paths chronicle Hisao's deepening and eventually romantic relationship (or lack thereof) with one of the five main female characters; these may variously end well, badly, or neutrally.", "developer": ["Four Leaf Studios"], "genre": "Visual novel", "date_release": "2012-01-24"}, "Kentucky Route Zero": {"composer": "Ben Babbitt", "description": "Kentucky Route Zero is a magical realist, episodic, point and click adventure game created and published by indie developers Jake Elliott, Tamas Kemenczy, and Ben Babbitt under the name Cardboard Computer.
