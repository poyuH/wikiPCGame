It was released in May 2011 for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, in November 2011 for Microsoft Windows, and in November 2017 for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. The story is set in Los Angeles in 1947 and follows a Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) officer, who solves a range of cases across five divisions. Players must investigate crime scenes for clues, follow up leads, and interrogate suspects; the player's success at these activities will impact how much of each case's story is revealed.\nThe open-world design lets players freely roam Los Angeles' open landscape, and its world is navigated on foot or by vehicle. The story is centred on the case sequences, and many missions involve shooting and driving gameplay. It is played through a third-person perspective. L.A. Noire also contains elements found in action-adventure games, such as side missions and a branching storyline. The game uses licensed music provided by an in-game radio, and features an original score.The development of L.A. Noire began in 2004, shortly after the founding of Team Bondi, and was shared between the multiple Rockstar studios around the world. The game was delayed numerous times through its seven-year development, which included a change of publisher and platforms. The working hours and managerial style of the studio was met with public complaints from staff members, and Team Bondi closed shortly after the game's initial release. The development team found influence from the plot and aesthetic elements of film noir\u2014stylistic films made popular in the 1940s and 1950s that share similar visual styles and themes, including crime and moral ambiguity\u2014along with drawing inspiration from real-life crimes of the time for its in-game cases.The game is notable for being the first to use the newly developed MotionScan technology developed by Depth Analysis. MotionScan uses 32 surrounding cameras to capture actors' facial expressions from every angle. The technology is central to the game's interrogation mechanic, as the player is required to use the suspects' reactions to questioning to judge whether or not they are lying. Over twenty hours of voice work was recorded for the game.\nExtensively marketed, L.A. Noire was the first video game to be shown at the Tribeca Film Festival, and received widespread critical acclaim for its advances in storytelling, presentation, and facial animation technology. It had been reported to ship over five million copies worldwide. L.A.
