The game was published for the Xbox in 2005 and Microsoft Windows in 2006. Call of Cthulhu: Dark Corners of the Earth combines an action-adventure game with a relatively realistic first-person shooter and elements of a stealth game.\nThe game is based on the works of H. P. Lovecraft, author of \"The Call of Cthulhu\" and progenitor of the Cthulhu Mythos. It is a reimagining of Lovecraft's 1936 novella The Shadow over Innsmouth. Set mostly in the year 1922, the story follows Jack Walters, a mentally unstable private detective hired to investigate in Innsmouth, a strange and mysterious town that has cut itself off from the rest of the United States.\nIn development since 1999, the project was repeatedly delayed, going through several revisions and having some of its most ambitious and immersive features abandoned and the initially planned PlayStation 2 version cancelled. Although well received by most critics and regarded by some as one of the best horror video games of all time, Dark Corners of the Earth was a commercial failure. At least two additional Cthulhu Mythos games were planned by Headfirst Productions, including a direct sequel titled Call of Cthulhu: Destiny's End, but neither were completed due to Headfirst's bankruptcy.", "developer": ["Headfirst Productions"], "genre": "Survival horror", "date_release": "2005-10-24"}, "Call of Duty": {"producer": "Vince Zampella", "composer": null, "description": "Call of Duty  is a first-person shooter video game franchise published by Activision.

Instead, it features the Solo Missions mode, which focuses on the backstories of the game's multiplayer characters, known as \"Specialists\".

Like nickel, cobalt is found in the Earth's crust only in chemically combined form, save for small deposits found in alloys of natural meteoric iron. The free element, produced by reductive smelting, is a hard, lustrous, silver-gray metal.\nCobalt-based blue pigments (cobalt blue) have been used since ancient times for jewelry and paints, and to impart a distinctive blue tint to glass, but the color was later thought to be due to the known metal bismuth. Miners had long used the name kobold ore (German for goblin ore) for some of the blue-pigment producing minerals; they were so named because they were poor in known metals, and gave poisonous arsenic-containing fumes when smelted. In 1735, such ores were found to be reducible to a new metal (the first discovered since ancient times), and this was ultimately named for the kobold.\nToday, some cobalt is produced specifically from one of a number of metallic-lustered ores, such as cobaltite (CoAsS). The element is however more usually produced as a by-product of copper and nickel mining. The copper belt in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and Zambia yields most of the global cobalt production. The DRC alone accounted for more than 50% of world production in 2016 (123,000 tonnes), according to Natural Resources Canada.Cobalt is primarily used in lithium-ion batteries, and in the manufacture of magnetic, wear-resistant and high-strength alloys. The compounds cobalt silicate and cobalt(II) aluminate (CoAl2O4, cobalt blue) give a distinctive deep blue color to glass, ceramics, inks, paints and varnishes. Cobalt occurs naturally as only one stable isotope, cobalt-59. Cobalt-60 is a commercially important radioisotope, used as a radioactive tracer and for the production of high energy gamma rays.\nCobalt is the active center of a group of coenzymes called cobalamins. Vitamin B12, the best-known example of the type, is an essential vitamin for all animals.

Born in Naissus, in Dacia Ripensis, city now known as Ni\u0161 (Serbian Cyrillic: \u041d\u0438\u0448, located in Serbia), he was the son of Flavius Valerius Constantius, a Roman Army officer of Illyrian origins.  His mother Helena was Greek. His father became Caesar, the deputy emperor in the west, in 293 AD. Constantine was sent east, where he rose through the ranks to become a military tribune under Emperors Diocletian and Galerius. In 305, Constantius was raised to the rank of Augustus, senior western emperor, and Constantine was recalled west to campaign under his father in Britannia (Britain).  Constantine was acclaimed as emperor by the army at Eboracum (modern-day York) after his father's death in 306 AD.  He emerged victorious in a series of civil wars against Emperors Maxentius and Licinius to become sole ruler of both west and east by 324 AD.\nAs emperor, Constantine enacted administrative, financial, social, and military reforms to strengthen the empire.  He restructured the government, separating civil and military authorities.  To combat inflation he introduced the solidus, a new gold coin that became the standard for Byzantine and European currencies for more than a thousand years.  The Roman army was reorganised to consist of mobile field units and garrison soldiers capable of countering internal threats and barbarian invasions.  Constantine pursued successful campaigns against the tribes on the Roman frontiers\u2014the Franks, the Alamanni, the Goths, and the Sarmatians\u2014even resettling territories abandoned by his predecessors during the Crisis of the Third Century.\nConstantine was the first Roman emperor to convert to Christianity. Although he lived much of his life as a pagan, and later as a catechumen, he joined the Christian faith on his deathbed, being baptised by Eusebius of Nicomedia.  He played an influential role in the proclamation of the Edict of Milan in 313, which declared religious tolerance for Christianity in the Roman empire.  He called the First Council of Nicaea in 325, which produced the statement of Christian belief known as the Nicene Creed.  The Church of the Holy Sepulchre was built on his orders at the purported site of Jesus' tomb in Jerusalem and became the holiest place in Christendom.  The Papal claim to temporal power in the High Middle Ages was based on the forged Donation of Constantine. He has historically been referred to as the \"First Christian Emperor\", and he did heavily promote the Christian Church.  Some modern scholars, however, debate his beliefs and even his comprehension of the Christian faith itself.The age of Constantine marked a distinct epoch in the history of the Roman Empire.  He built a new imperial residence at Byzantium and renamed the city Constantinople (now Istanbul) after himself (the laudatory epithet of \"New Rome\" came later, and was never an official title).  It became the capital of the Empire for more than a thousand years, with the later eastern Roman Empire, now being referred to as the Byzantine Empire by historians.  His more immediate political legacy was that he replaced Diocletian's tetrarchy with the principle of dynastic succession by leaving the empire to his sons.  His reputation flourished during the lifetime of his children and for centuries after his reign.  The medieval church upheld him as a paragon of virtue, while secular rulers invoked him as a prototype, a point of reference, and the symbol of imperial legitimacy and identity.  Beginning with the Renaissance, there were more critical appraisals of his reign, due to the rediscovery of anti-Constantinian sources.
