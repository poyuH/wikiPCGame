Ancient cultures in Persia, Greece, Babylonia, Japan, Tibet, and India had similar lists, sometimes referring in local languages to \"air\" as \"wind\" and the fifth element as \"void\".  The Chinese Wu Xing system lists Wood (\u6728 m\u00f9), Fire (\u706b hu\u01d2), Earth (\u571f t\u01d4), Metal (\u91d1 j\u012bn), and Water (\u6c34 shu\u01d0), though these are described more as energies or transitions rather than as types of material.\nThese different cultures and even individual philosophers had widely varying explanations concerning their attributes and how they related to observable phenomena as well as cosmology.  Sometimes these theories overlapped with mythology and were personified in deities.  Some of these interpretations included atomism (the idea of very small, indivisible portions of matter), but other interpretations considered the elements to be divisible into infinitely small pieces without changing their nature.\nWhile the classification of the material world in ancient Indian, Hellenistic Egypt, and ancient Greece into Air, Earth, Fire and Water was more philosophical, during the Islamic Golden Age medieval middle eastern scientists used practical, experimental observation to classify materials. In Europe, the Ancient Greek system of Aristotle evolved slightly into the medieval system, which for the first time in Europe became subject to experimental verification in the 1600s, during the Scientific Revolution.\nModern science does not support the classical elements as the material basis of the physical world.  Atomic theory classifies atoms into more than a hundred chemical elements such as oxygen, iron, and mercury.  These elements form chemical compounds and mixtures, and under different temperatures and pressures, these substances can adopt different states of matter.  The most commonly observed states of solid, liquid, gas, and plasma share many attributes with the classical elements of earth, water, air, and fire, respectively, but these states are due to similar behavior of different types of atoms at similar energy levels, and not due to containing a certain type of atom or a certain type of substance.", "genre": "Adventure Game", "date_release": "2008-09-03"}, "4Story": {"description": "Toy Story 4 is a 2019 American computer-animated comedy film produced by Pixar Animation Studios for Walt Disney Pictures.
